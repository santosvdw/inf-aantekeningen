**Set Theory**

## Sets
A set is an unordered collection of elements/members. The notation for an element $a$ contained in $A$ is $a \in A$. The elements of a set can take on any type, but all elements in the set should have the same type.

Some important sets to know are:
- $\N \N_0$ - natural numbers ({0,1,2,3,...})
